term	definition
extant	IUCN: The species is known or thought very likely to occur presently in the area, which encompasses localities with current or recent (last 20-30 years) records where suitable habitat at appropriate altitudes remains. Extant ranges are included in the calculation of extent of occurrence and in maps of the historical distribution  of the species.
possibly extant	IUCN: There is no record of the species in the area, but the species may possibly occur.
possibly extinct  IUCN:	The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area, but it has been confirmed that the species no longer occurs because exhaustive searches have failed to produce recent records, and the intensity and timing of threats could plausibly have extirpated the taxon. Extinct ranges are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence, but are included in maps of the historical distribution of the taxon.
extinct (post 1500)	IUCN: The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area (post 1500 AD), but it has been confirmed that the species no longer occurs because exhaustive searches have failed to produce recent records, and the intensity and timing of threats could plausibly have extirpated the taxon. Extinct ranges are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence, but are included in maps of the historical distribution of the taxon.
presence uncertain	IUCN: A record exists of the species' presence in the area, but this record requires verification or is rendered questionable owing to uncertainty over the identity or authenticity of the record, or the accuracy of the location. Presence uncertain records are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence or in maps of the historical distribution of the taxon
absent  this term is not present in the IUCN vocabulary however, retaining it will improve the back compatibility with the former usage of occurrenceStatus
